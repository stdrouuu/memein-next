## About This Project  
This is a meme maker app called MemeIn that I built using **Next.js**, with **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Shadcn**. I used **Konva** Javascript library to implement the canvas functionality, so users can upload images and edit them directly on the canvas. I also try adding support for light, dark, and system themes so users can switch based on their preference or device settings. 

I'm still learning TypeScript, and this project has been a great way to practice it.


## Getting Started
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
